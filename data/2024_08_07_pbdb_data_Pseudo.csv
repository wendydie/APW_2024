In the Moenave type section, near Tuba City, Arizona, all of the Moenave section is Dinosaur Canyon Member, as it is throughout the Moenave outcrop belt along the Echo Cliffs and Ward's Terrace of northern Arizona. However, north of the Grand Canyon in Arizona and in southwestern Utah, the upper part of the Moenave Formation is lacustrine strata. These strata are the Whitmore Point Member.\r\nLucas et al. (2011: Palaeo3 302: 194-205) proposed, on the basis of multiple lines of biostratigraphic evidence, that the Triassic–Jurassic boundary is placed within the middle part of the Whitmore Point Member of the Moenave Formation where this member is present, and high in the Dinosaur Canyon Member elsewhere.  The ""Whitmore Point assemblage"" of vertebrate taxa, earliest Jurassic (Hettangian) in age. The underlying ""Dinosaur Canyon assemblage"", is latest Triassic (Rhaetian) in age.\r\n\r\nSuarez et al. 2017: Detrital zircon chronology suggested that the upper Dinosaur Canyon is younger than 201.33Ma ","Protosuchus specimen preserved in a soft reddish-brown sandstone.","sandstone","red,red or brown","poorly lithified","","","","","","","","terrestrial indet.","","","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body","good","","","","","","","","","","","skull is ""distorted""","taxonomic","field collection","MCZ","","","","","","","","terrestrial","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","phosphatic","","",""

However, north of the Grand Canyon in Arizona and in southwestern Utah, the upper part of the Moenave Formation is lacustrine strata. These strata are the Whitmore Point Member.\r\nLucas et al.

This is suggested by the common association of skulls with mandibles and bones of the pectoral girdle. Winnowing was frequent and many disarticulated bones occur in lenticular intercalations of calcareous grainstone. The clavicles usually occur with their convex side down, indicating deposition from suspension. Closed shells of unionid bivalves cooccur, which probably died from suffocation under the load of dysaerobic mud.""","taxonomic","selective quarrying,chemical,mechanical,field collection","","some microfossils","","","","2000–","","","terrestrial","","actively mobile","","","herbivore","","","","phosphatic","","",""

Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation.

The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage.

Clasts of permineralized wood and rarer presumed charcoal are commonly found in association with vertebrate remains. Diagenetic gypsum and calcite spar is common. The conglomerates alternate with finer layers of green to pale grey mudstone and siltstone that often include root traces and other organics, but do not show any large-scale evidence of oxidation.""","conglomerate","gypsiferous,intraclastic,brown,yellow","","sandy","Y","siltstone","gray,green","","","","coarse channel fill","","""repeated transient flooding events concentrated vertebrate (bones, carcasses, live animals) and plant material from the landscape surface, possibly in hyperconcentrated flows. These events were separated by periods of standing water and weakly-developed, poorly-drained (hydromorphic) soil formation. The hydromorphic nature of the paleosols is evidenced by the drab matrix colorations, abundance of yellow-brown (goethite) mottles, preservation of organic matter, including local leaf litter, predominance of goethite rhizocretions, and general dearth of other redoximorphic features. The high density of channel deposits incised into overbank sediments in the Petrified Forest Member indicate that avulsions were common on the Late Triassic landscape of the Chama Basin, and therefore that the Petrified Forest Member fluvial systems were unstable in this area. This large-scale instability in the local base level and resulting incision has also been reported for the Petrified Forest Member in northern Arizona""","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body","good","","","concentrate","concentrated","","","","occasional","","","","taxonomic","selective quarrying,mechanical,field collection","","","","","Irmis, Nesbitt, Turner, et. al.","2006-","","","terrestrial","","actively mobile","","","carnivore","","","","phosphatic","","",""

Patterson and Owen (1991) suggested that the major marine transgression during the Toarcian might have been instrumental for the invasion of the European Liassic fishes in the circumtethyean continents including parts of Indian subcontinent. Recovery of Darwinula, an early Middle Jurassic ostracod, led Govindan (1975) to suggest a Middle Jurassic age for the Kota Formation. Analysing the faunas of the underlying Dharmaram Formation and of the lower and upper units of the Kota Formation and comparing them with faunas from coeval horizons, Bandyopadhyay and Roychowdhury (1996) and Bandyopadhyay and Sengupta (2006) suggested that the Lower Kota Formation has an age ranging from Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, while the age of the upper Kota is Toarcian and may even be extended to Middle Jurassic (?Aalenian).""

This claystone layer grades upward into variegated red (10R 3/1), purple (10R 5/2), and gray (N/5) clayey siltstone at the top of the exposure, upon which gastropod and bivalve shells can be found. This layer contains light greenish gray (5GY 7/1) mottles and numerous carbonate nodules (1.0–5.0 cm). Cracks filled with sandy and silty material are evident in thin section, but no b-fabric has developed, showing that this layer was not altered by pedoturbation. No rhizoliths or burrows were observed in this layer, suggesting that sediment was deposited rapidly.""","""siliciclastic""","desiccation cracks,paleosol/pedogenic,gray","","","Y","siltstone","desiccation cracks,nodular,gray,red","","","Y","fine channel fill","","""deposited in a localized, scoured depression, such as an abandoned channel or chute where flow velocities were limited""","macrofossils","","","","","","","","body","good","","","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","selective quarrying,field collection","","","","","","","PEFO: Petrified Forest National Park, Arizona","","terrestrial","","actively mobile","","","herbivore","","","","phosphatic","","",""

Earth Env. Sci. Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin. 101:333-349). The relevant part of the Ischigualasto Formation has been dated as late Carnian in age on radioisotopic data (e.g. Martinez et al. 2011. Science 331: 206-210), and the Tiki Formation is commonly considered equivalent in age.","""The Lower Tiki Formation, about 28-30m thick, is characterized by presence of predominantly reddish mudstone/claystone with thin calcareous intercalations, laminated siltstone, calcarenite, limestone and feldspathic quartzarenite. The non-laminated mudstone beds usually contain calcareous globules, calcified rootlets, calcareous nodules, and small to large concretions. The Upper Tiki Formation overlying the conglomerate bed containing lime-pellet comprises mainly of sandstone and reddish mudstone which are deposited as an alternate sequence.

The Zbaszynek Beds are correlated with the Upper Keuper formations (Arnstadt Formation and lowermost Exter Formation) from the Germanic Basin (see Bachmann and Kozur, 2004; Franz et al., 2007a, 2007b)... palynomorph taxa are known only from other central European sites believed to correspond to the late Norian and Rhaetian stages.

The whole observed stratigraphic section in this locality is at least 6 m thick and is partially exposed in the northern part of Por  eba city, near the old waste dump (Fig. 1), about 4 km from Zawiercie, southern Poland (Szulc et al., 2006).Well-preserved, often eroded or rounded vertebrate bones or fragments of bones occur mainly in yellowish carbonate conglomerates; sometimes the bones are covered with a calcareous crust, rather than a more typical pyritic crust.

Bones of a large carnivorous archosaur and osteoderms of aetosaurs are very rare at this locality. Other vertebrate remains, including dipnoan teeth, hybodont shark fin spines, and ganoid skull elements and scales, are also rare. These strata also contain numerous well-preserved micro- and macrofloral remains. The dominant plant species at Poreba is a conifer similar to Brachyphyllum sp. Fragments of branches with leaves and numerous fragments of charcoalized wood trunks, sometimes of large size, also occur (Fig. 2A, B). Abundant pollen of cf. Classopollis sp., which occur at Poreba in the gray facies, has elsewhere been associated with plants from the Cheirolepidiaceae (Reymanowna, 1992). The probable ginkgoalean palynomorph Monosulcites sp., as well as probable ginkgoalean leaves with perpendicular veins, were found but are too poorly preserved for detailed taxonomic descriptions. The liverwort spore Ricciisporites tuberculatus Lundblad, 1954, is also present at Poreba...well-preserved bivalve shells similar to freshwater unionids from Marciszow (Skawina and Dzik, 2011) were also recovered.

The best age estimates come from palynological and vertebrate biostratigraphy. Litwin and his colleagues (1986; Litwin et al. 1991) described Norian-aged palynological assemblages from the approximate level of the Canjilon Quarry, and assemblages from the overlying “upper siltstone” member (which contains the Coelophysis Quarry) that are no older than mid-Norian in age. The HQ assemblage includes several biostratigraphically useful vertebrate taxa: pseudopalatine phytosaurs, and the aetosaurs Typothorax coccinarum and Rioarribasuchus chamaensis. These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation. Detrital zircons from the Black Forest Tuff indicate a maximum 206Pb/238U age of 213 Ma (Riggs et al. 2003). The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary. This age assignment is also consistent with preliminary results from magnetostratigraphy in the Chama Basin (Zeigler et al. 2005).""","""The HQ deposits are contained within fossiliferous mudstones, siltstones, and sandy conglomerates that form channel deposits incised into red overbank mudstones and siltstones. The conglomerates are poorly sorted, range in color from brown to yellow and are dominated by intraformational carbonate clasts ranging in size from coarse sand to pebbles. Clasts of permineralized wood and rarer presumed charcoal are commonly found in association with vertebrate remains. Diagenetic gypsum and calcite spar is common.

The bonebed is most likely older than Jurassic, however, because it is located considerably below Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) basalts in local section. The Portuguese CAMP basalts have been radioisotopically dated at 198.1 Ma, which would place the basalts in the earliest Jurassic (Sinemurian). However, these dates need to be corrected for decay constant bias and are likely to be a few million years older. In any event, the Portuguese basalts are likely somewhat younger than many other radioisotopically dated CAMP sections in North America and North Africa. A more precise Triassic age determination of the bonebed is not currently possible, because the stratigraphy and geochronology of the Gres de Silves Formation have only been studied in cursory detail. Our research group is currently revising the geology of the formation, and we recently tentatively proposed, based on vertebrate biostratigraphy, that at least part of the ‘AB2’ unit (i.e., that containing the Penina Bonebed) is likely to be late Carnian–Norian in age"" (Brusatte et al. 2014)","""The fossil-bearing bed is a 40 cm thick layer of fine sandstone with a high clay content, that crops out over a length of just 10 m...The layer contains several large bone fragments whose white-bluish colour is conspicuous in the light-red sandstone matrix...The fossiliferous layers at both localities consist of lenses of sandstone within an approximately 200 m thick sequence of red mudstones, the thickest member of the Grès de Silves Formation.""

The palaeoenvironment can be reconstructed as a broad coastal plain with several streams flowing into the sea, and sediment from the nearby, raised hinterland accumulated in fans on the shore (Palain 1976). Schröter (1981) interpreted the mudstones as deltaic sediments with the lenses of sandstone being fluviatile deposits, e.g., from anastomosing deltaic streams. Alternatively, he pointed out that the mudstones might represent tidal sediments, and the lenses of sandstones could be the fillings of estuarine channels. However, Schröter (1981) did not observe tidal sedimentary structures, such as herringbone cross-stratification or flaser bedding, which detracts from the second interpretation.""

However, ledge-forming sandstones and conglomerates up to a few meters thick are almost always interbedded with the fine-grained middle beds. In Spiller Canyon on the northern side of Skull Ridge (figure 9H), and locally at Eagle’s Nest (figure 9G), the middle beds contain interbedded mudstones and ledge-forming sandstones with fissile horizontal laminated beds. The middle beds of the Kane Springs beds also contain blocks of tilted strata that may represent foreset bedding or slump blocks. The middle beds probably represent poorly-drained lacustrine and deltaic environments traversed by streams and are very similar to the fluvial, lacustrine and deltaic deposits of the Monitor Butte Member (Blakey and Gubitosa, 1983; Dubiel, 1987; Dubiel and Hasiotis, 2011). The Monitor Butte Member also contains black mudstones with interbedded coal that have been interpreted as paludal deposits forming in lake and marsh environments (Dubiel and Hasiotis, 2011), but these are absent in the Kane Springs beds.

These taxa are only found in sediments with Norian pollen at Petrified Forest National Park (PEFO), Arizona and other Chinle Formation localities. Furthermore, pseudopalatine phytosaurs and Typothorax are found both above and below the Black Forest Tuff at PEFO, a local marker bed that yielded the only published radiometric date in the Chinle Formation.

The association of vertebrate taxa found at this stratigraphic level has a longer range both above and below the Black Forest Tuff, so it is not clear what part of this range correlates with the HQ assemblage. Nonetheless, a broadly Norian age for the HQ assemblage is justified because both the vertebrates and pollen provide an unambiguous Norian signal, and there is at present no evidence to the contrary.
